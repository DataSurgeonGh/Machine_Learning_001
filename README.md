My Machine Learning Tutorials
This tutorial use DecisionTree Classifier
I use the video games sales dataset from kaggle
Using the common libraries such as numpy and pandas and sklearn
I imported the video games sales dataset in csv format in a names dataframe
I performed some basic summary statistics on the data after viewing a few records to know how the data look like using head()
After performing a few statistics, I divide the data into dependent and independent variables(X), where the dependent(Y) variable is the variable of interest I want to predict, whiles the independent variable is the variable I will be using to predict. In this particular case, the Y is the genre of music whiles the X are the gender and age.
I call the decisionTree model and then fit the model to the data.
I then tried to predict using the fitted model. I observed my model was able to predict well, even though I have not used any model accuracy test to chech the accuracy of my model.
I wanted to view the nature of my model, so I exported it into a graphical conceptual model
The idea was to see hoe the model does the classification. The output was viewed in VScode.
The rest will be continued and updated
